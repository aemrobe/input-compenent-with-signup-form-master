## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"[Field Name] cannot be empty"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Looks like this is not an email"_

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- javascript

### What I learned

in this challenge I have learned about form validation,form events and regex patterns.
inorder to validate your form you should add an submit eventLisener to your form instead of putting the click event on the submit button because by doing that you can address the different kind of submit event(i.e if the user click enter after he/she pass his/her input) otherwise we can't address this event.

### Continued development

I am learning javascript so I want to do challenges and project which can make me to better understand javascript.

### Useful resources

- [Net Ninja regex expression playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6I-Ahc0HB4&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9g6m_6Sld9Q4jzqdqHd2HiD&ab_channel=TheNetNinja) - this helped me to know the basics of using regex expression in the form validation
- [Modern Javascript](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-novice-to-ninja/) - This is a udemy course which helps me to understand about form validation and dom associated with the form validation.
